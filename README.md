# Excel-Analyze-and-reporting-San-Francisco-salaries-data

# Description
This data is taken from the Kaggle website, which is registered data for the salaries of 
employees in San Francisco state for four years.

Observing and analyzing the salaries of employees helps us to understand the general state
of salaries, understanding the criteria by which the salary can be expected, the jobs that
are popular in a region that reflects the social situation and the level of prosperity and
happiness, detecting corruption in the state and many other advantages that we obtain 
through salary analysis employees.

In this project I cleaned the data using Python starting from reading it as "csv" file and
exploring it and then cleaning it and finally saving it as an "xlsx" file.

I explored the cleaned data using Excel, and deleted some unnecessary columns, then
asked some questions about the data in the "analysis" sheet, then I made a simple 
report using the answers "Report" sheet, and I also built a very simple dashbord in "Dashboard" sheet.
